# Memestagram

Memes are one of the greatest symbols of social media. They’re edgy. They’re funny. They’re easy to iterate on, and every week, a new one pops up. But despite their popularity, it seems like there is no place for us to share or collect them. Memestagram is here for you! It’s a meme only platform. Whether you want to share the meme that you create or look for some interesting memes. Just join us!
